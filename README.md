		 west. In order to call this method successfully:

		 called. If a wall is blocking your way you will receive a FAIL 
	         indicating that your command was unsuccessful or SUCCESS
                 otherwise.

       indicating that pickup was unsuccessful followed by your amount of gold before   
       PICKUP was called. If you do happen to stumble upon gold and use PICKUP,   
       SUCCESS will be displayed followed by your updated amount of gold. To activate the command type: PICKUP

      accessible by the bot. To activate this command type: LOOK
                 

QUIT:Feeling tired of playing? You can simply quit the game with this command. This command will  
     return loose if you weren't able to collect all the gold on the map regardless of if you are 
     standing on an exit tile. In the unexpected case that you were in fact standing on an exit    
     tile and had collected all of the gold you would in fact win. To activate this command type in QUIT

 Any other method apart from this will return you a message saying that your input was 
 invalid. Whether your turn was successful or not this will still count as a turn.
 If you enter the wrong input, don't worry you have 3 tries to enter the right command
 Or invalid will be returned.

Ending conditions:
The game will only end if you land on an exit tile and call the QUIT method, 
having enough gold to satisfy the win condition
Or if the bot catches you.
